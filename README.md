### Shipment Logistics Analysis
The main objectives of this task are:
1) to analyse carrier performance using KPI's such as on-time delivery of shipments
2) to identify and mitigate the risks associated with potential delivery delays
3) to predict the likelihood of delay for shipments to improve timeliness of deliveries in the future

### Datasets
The project uses the following datasets, all in CSV format:

GPS_data.csv: contains GPS tracking data for each shipment.

New_bookings.csv: contains data on new shipment bookings that the predictive model will be used to predict on.

Shipment_bookings.csv: contains historical data on shipment bookings. this data is used to train the predictive model.

### Pre-requisites
